# DuckDuckGo
I simply just recommend going to `noai.duckduckgo.com` instead of the main website. It should automatically remove all AI results.

## Images
DuckDuckGo has an option to remove AI images from search results. While it may not be perfect, I find it to be fairly effective.
In the `Images` tab, click on the `AI images:` filter, then set it to `hide`.
